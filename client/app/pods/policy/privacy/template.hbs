            <h2>TrueCron Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>(Last Updated: Jan 28, 2009)</p>
            <p>Naviam, Inc. ("Naviam" or "we") has created this privacy policy (the "Policy") to explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our Pivotal Tracker services ("Service") and Web site located at http://www.pivotaltracker.com ("Site"). By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.</p>
            <p>Because of changes in technology and the growth and development of our business, Naviam may need to modify this Policy from time to time. Changes to this Policy are discussed at the end of this document.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">1. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h3>
            <p>Naviam collects, uses and discloses two types of information: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. "Personal Information" is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a user's name, initials or nickname, e-mail address, and user-chosen ID and password. "Non-Personal Information" is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">2. CHILDREN</h3>
            <p>The Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">3. GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

                    <h4>Gathering Non-Personal Information</h4>
                    (i) Web Browsers
                    <p>Like most Site operators, Naviam gathers from users of the Site Non-Personal Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the user's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Site.</p>
                    (ii) Cookies
                    <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a Site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. Naviam uses cookies to track a user's use of the Site during each Site session, both to help Naviam improve users' experiences and to help Naviam understand how the Site is being used.

Naviam may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information by means of the cookies used in connection with Google Web Analytics, and such use is subject to this Policy.

                    (iv) Web Beacons
                    <p>A "Web Beacon" is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to users but allows Site operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides.</p>
                    <p>You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. Third parties are not permitted to use Web Beacons on the Site.</p>
