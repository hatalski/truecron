            <h3 class="text-uppercase">4. GRANT OF LICENSE TO NAVIAM</h3>
            <p><b>As between you and Naviam, you exclusively own all rights in and to the Contributions that you submit to the Naviam Site.</b> Naviam needs a limited license from you so that we can use your Contributions to make the TrueCron Services and Naviam Site available to you. For example, if you upload product specifications, product drawings or a animated graphic presentation of how a product works to the Naviam Site, we need a license from you to display, perform and distribute these Contributions in order to make these Contributions available to you on your project pages. And, if you permit third parties (such as your customers or consultants) to view your project pages, we need to have a license to sub-license your Contributions to these third parties so that they can view and use your group pages.</p>
            <p>By making a Contribution to the Naviam Site, you grant to Naviam a limited, perpetual, non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Contribution to anyone else in addition to Naviam), fully-paid, royalty-free (meaning that Naviam is not required to pay you to use your Contribution), sub-licensable (subject to the restrictions below), transferable (solely because we need the right to transfer this license to a successor Naviam Site operator) and worldwide (because the Internet and the Naviam Site are global in reach) license to use, modify, perform, display, reproduce and distribute the Contribution for the sole purpose of operating the Naviam Site and TrueCron Services. Naviam needs the right to “modify” and “reproduce” your Content, because the software and servers hosting the Naviam Site modify and reproduce your Content automatically in order to make the Naviam Site and TrueCron Service available.</p>
            <p>We will only sublicense your Contribution for the following purposes: (a) to make your Contributions available to any third party (such as a client or a contractor) that you permit to view your project pages on the Naviam Site; and (b) to permit a third party hosted services provider to host the Naviam Site.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">5. RESTRICTIONS</h3>
            <p>Customer shall not: (a) rent, lease or loan the TrueCron Service; (b) conduct automated functionality tests or load tests on the TrueCron Service; (c) attempt to gain access to data that is not Customer’s Data, or use a disproportionate amount of the TrueCron Service that interrupts or degrades the TrueCron Service; or (d) use the TrueCron Service in any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation, including without limitation any third party copyright or other intellectual property or proprietary right.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">6. MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT</h3>
            <p>Naviam will provide maintenance and support services in accordance with the terms of the Plan selected by Customer. Naviam’s obligations, if any, to provide maintenance and support is subject to the following: (a) Customer shall provide Naviam with access to its employees to duplicate and resolve errors; (b) Customer shall provide supervision, control and management of the use of the TrueCron Service; (c) Customer shall document and promptly report all errors or malfunctions in the TrueCron Services to Naviam, and (d) Customer shall take all steps necessary to carry out procedures for the rectification of errors or malfunctions within a reasonable time after such procedures have been received from Naviam.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">7. EVALUATION TRIAL; SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND PAYMENT</h3>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Evaluation Trial.</b> When an Account is first created, an Account is automatically placed on a thirty (30) day free evaluation trial (the “Evaluation Trial”). During the Evaluation Trial, an unlimited number of Projects and Project Members may be associated with the Account, and the Account shall have access to the full functionality of the TrueCron Service. A credit card is not required for the Evaluation Trial. At the end of the Evaluation Trial, if the User does not explicitly upgrade to a paid Plan, the Account will transition to the free Plan as described on the Plans and Billing Page. If the Account exceeds the limits associated with the free Plan, the Account will be suspended, and all Projects in the Account will become read-only until the Account is either (a) brought below the free Plan limits or (b) User purchases a paid Plan for which such Account qualifies. A User may upgrade an Account to a paid Plan prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Trial, but Naviam will not charge a User fees until after the Evaluation Trial except as may be set forth on the Plans and Billing Page.
                    Only the first Account that a User creates will be subject to the Evaluation Trial. Additional Accounts that a User creates will start on the free Plan, as published on the Plans and Billing Page. Users may not move Projects in or out of Accounts that are on the Evaluation Trial. Each User is entitled to only one Evaluation Trial. If a User is a company, only one employee or consultant of such User is entitled to receive the Evaluation Trial.</li>
                <li><b>Subscription Fees.</b> The amount of the Subscription Fees, if any, are determined by the Plan selected on the Plans and Billing Page. If a Paid User wants to add more users that are permitted under Paid User’s Plan, the Paid User must upgrade to a Plan with higher member limits. Subscription Fees for the new Plan will be calculated on a pro-rated basis for the remainder of the Term as specified in more detail on the Plans and Billing Page. In the event of cancellation or termination of this Agreement, no refunds will be made. User is responsible for all taxes, other than taxes levied on Naviam’s income. Subscription Fees do not include any applicable taxes. If Naviam is required to pay any sales, use, goods and services, value added, or other taxes in relation to Paid User’s purchase, those taxes will be billed to and paid by Paid User.</li>
                <li><b>Payment.</b> Paid Users shall select either annual or monthly billing for the applicable Subscription Fees. Paid User shall pay the Subscription Fees to Naviam on the date Paid User first upgrades to a paid Plan (the “First Upgrade Date”) and on every monthly anniversary thereof (if Paid User has selected monthly billing) during the term of the Agreement and on every yearly anniversary of the Effective Date (if Paid User has selected annual billing) during the term of the Agreement. All Subscription Fees will be automatically billed to Paid User’s credit card. Paid User may upgrade from a paid Plan to another paid Plan at any point during the then-current term of the Agreement, and Paid User will be immediately charged, on a pro-rated basis, for the remainder of the then-current billing cycle. If either party terminates the Agreement before the end of the then-current term, Naviam shall not refund any fees to Paid User.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">8. TERM, TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Term.</b>	This Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for the Term subject to earlier termination by either Naviam or Customer in accordance with this Agreement. Thereafter, the Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless and until either party provides written notice to the other party, at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of its intention not to renew the Agreement or unless earlier terminated by either party in accordance with this Agreement.</li>
                <li><b>Termination.</b> Either party may immediately terminate this Agreement as follows: (a) if either party materially breaches its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after it has been notified in writing of such breach; or (b) if either party has instituted against it any proceedings seeking relief, reorganization or arrangement under any laws relating to insolvency and such proceeding is not resolved within sixty (60) days.</li>
                <li><b>Survival.</b> The provisions of Sections 1, 2.4, 2.5, 3-5, 7.2, 7.3 and 8-17 shall survive the cancellation or termination of this Agreement. All other provisions of this Agreement, which by their terms or import are intended to survive such cancellation or termination, shall survive.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">9. NO LICENSE; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP</h3>
            <p>Naviam hereby reserves all right, title and interest in and to the TrueCron Service and all intellectual property rights related thereto not expressly granted in this Agreement. Customer shall not reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the TrueCron Services.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">10. CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Definition.</b> “Confidential Information” shall mean all non-public information, whether in oral, written or other tangible form that either party (“Discloser”) discloses to the other party (“Recipient”) as being confidential, including without limitation the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than (i) as a result of a disclosure by Recipient or its employees or any other person who directly or indirectly receives such information from Discloser or its employees or (ii) in violation of a confidentiality obligation to Discloser that is known to Recipient, (b) is or becomes available to Recipient on a non confidential basis from a source which is entitled to disclose it to the Recipient, (c) was developed by employees or agents of Recipient independently of and without reference to any information communicated to Recipient by Discloser, or (d) is disclosed pursuant to an order of a court or other governmental body; provided that Recipient shall provide prompt notice thereof to Discloser so as to afford Discloser an opportunity to intervene and prevent or limit any such disclosure.</li>
                <li><b>Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Obligation.</b> Recipient shall not make use of (except for purposes of this Agreement), or disseminate or in any way disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information. Recipient shall treat Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree (but not less than a reasonable degree) of care as it accords its own confidential information. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees who need to know such information and certifies that its employees have previously agreed, either as a condition to employment or in order to obtain the Confidential Information, to be bound by terms and conditions substantially similar to those of this Agreement. Recipient will immediately give notice to Discloser of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser’s Confidential Information and will use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist Discloser in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</h3>
            <p class="text-uppercase">CUSTOMER AGREES THAT CUSTOMER’S ACCESS TO AND USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE TRUECRON SERVICE IS AT CUSTOMER’S SOLE RISK.

SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, WAIVERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
            <p class="text-uppercase">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NAVIAM AND ITS CONTRACTORS OR LICENSORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE TRUECRON SERVICE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES WERE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL OF CUSTOMER’S CLAIMS AGAINST NAVIAM AND ITS CONTRACTORS AND LICENSORS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE VALUE PAID FOR USE OF THE TRUECRON SERVICE DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE A CLAIM IS MADE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK. SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, WAIVERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO SUCH CUSTOMERS.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">13. INDEMNIFICATION BY CUSTOMER</h3>
            <p>Customer will defend or settle, at Customer’s expense, any action brought against Naviam based upon the claim that any modifications Customer makes to the TrueCron Service or any combination of the TrueCron Service with TrueCron Service or other items not approved by Naviam infringes or violates any third party intellectual property right.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">14. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS</h3>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">16. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</h3>
            <p>Customer understands and agrees that its breach of this Agreement will cause Naviam irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Naviam shall therefore be entitled to obtain timely injunctive relief to protect Naviam’s rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all remedies available at law.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">17. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
            <p>This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties on the subject matter hereof. No amendment or modification hereof will be valid or binding upon the parties unless made in writing and signed by the duly authorized representatives of both parties. The relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed to imply that either party is the agent, employee, or joint venturer of the other. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect without said provision and will be interpreted to reflect the original intent of the parties. Customer may not assign this Agreement (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of Naviam and any prohibited assignment will be null and void. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties permitted successors and/or assignees. Waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement or the failure by either party to exercise any right hereunder will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of that right or as a waiver of any other right.</p>
